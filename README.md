# Outcome 3 - Programming Logic
This repo has been created as a demonstration of the Programming Logic skill attained in Outcome 3. As an aspiring Andelan, I now understand the fundamentals of how to break down problems into programmable logic and write reusable functions. Additionally, I'm also able to identify common problem areas where the performance of a program might be affected.

## This repo contains:
1. A function to generate prime numbers from 0 to n with asymptotic analysis in the prime-gen folder
2. A function to generate Fibonacci sequence from 0 to n with asymptotic analysis in the fibonacci-gen folder
